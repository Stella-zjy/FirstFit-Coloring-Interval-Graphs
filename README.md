# FirstFit-Coloring-Interval-Graphs
This is my course project for UofT CSC2421 Topics in Algorithms: Online and other Myopic Algorithms 
Course Instructor: Prof. Allan Borodin

## Abstract
This project investigates the 5-lower bound for First-Fit coloring on interval graphs, bridging theoretical analysis with numerical verification. We review the adversarial progression from walls to quasicaps and the gap-reduction argument used to establish worst-case performance ratio $R \ge 5$. Specifically, the classical wall construction gives a 3-lower bound, the wall-cap pipeline and the existence of a $4$-cap guarantee a 4-lower bound, and quasicaps plus gap-reduction provide key technical device for approaching the limiting ratio 5 from below. By simulating the underlying recurrence relation, we generate a feasibility landscape that numerically verifies the theoretical obstruction preventing the construction of a $5$-cap.
